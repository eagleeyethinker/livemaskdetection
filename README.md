# live mask detection

Real-time mask detector using Tensorflow, Keras, and OpenCV. 

This CNN Model is built using the TensorFlow framework and the OpenCV library which is highly used for real-time applications. This model can also be used to develop a full-fledged software to scan every person before they can enter the public gathering. Using this model, an accuracy of over 99% is obtained. This can also be used further to achieve more significant results.

A Transfer learning with inception model is used to predict the problem.

I created the dataset for this project. It is divided into two categories ie "with_face_mask" and "without_face_mask". The images where extracted from:
